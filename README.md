A hack for an old version of a brick game

## About
I wrote this primarily so some friends and I can mess around while I stay in-practice with reverse-engineering and game hacking. I have made the repository public to help serve my portfolio.

This hack fixes some bugs, bypasses some of the game's security checks, enables (mostly) unlocking its frame rate, and extends its Lua API to add and restore functionality, with possibly more to come.
